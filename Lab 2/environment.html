            <p>Tigers, as opposed to other cats, are not as grealty opposed to water or swimming in it. Swimming can be a good escape for a tiny cub, or just a chance to have fun and cool off. </p>

            <img src="images/Tiger_tree.jpg" alt="Tiger_tree">

            <p>Tigers can use trees and high places to their advantage in many ways. Tigers can bring their prey up into trees in order to stay away from other hungry critters. Trees are also a place that tigers can stay away from other animals or nuisances. </p>

            <h3 class="tiger_environments">Another tiger using water to its advantage</h3>
            <img src="images/Swimming_tiger.jpg" alt="Tiger_swimming">

            <p>Tigers can also use the water to hunt for their prey or just cool off. Tigers can rest in the water while just waiting for unsuspecting prey to come drink from the body of water they are currrently laying in. Tigers can also chill in the water on hot days.</p>
