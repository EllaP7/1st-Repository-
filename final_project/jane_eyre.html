                <h2>Jane Eyre</h2>
                <p>Jane Eyre tells the story of an orphan named Jane. Jane is raised by her hateful aunt, and loved by nobody. Jane is a woman who thinks and doesn't want to be trapped by what is expected of her. Although she is described as a woman with no beauty, she is still a wonderful and smart person. When she takes a job working as a governess for Mr. Rochester, she didn't expect to find love. Unfortunately, many things stand in their way, and a happy ending isn't always secure.</p>
